# What Is an Entity?
Entities are any objects or things from Peregrina Mundi that exhibit the ability to move on their own will. Though superficially similar to living things, their process of forming from the Mist itself calls for a unique classification system. No conclusive evidence has been found for them sharing any sort of "hive mind".

## How we classify them
We have observed that different Entities form depending on the conditions of the surrounding environment, but also come in many different shapes. While they usually have a Common Name (as do organisms do), they have a more scientific name which is based upon their characteristics and the conditions where the entity manifests.
