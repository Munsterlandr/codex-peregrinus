Excursions into Peregrina Mundi, though still in the early stages, have greatly expanded our knowledge and understanding of to composition of this alien plane. Unlike our own world, it seems to ultimately be made from only two elements, which combine to create everything.

# The Mist
Throughout Peregrina Mundi, a dark "mist" is seen. This substance is usually gaseous, in which state it's much more similar to fog in appearance, though it also often condenses into solid objects.

While its density varies throughout Peregrina Mundi, it does not equalize in pressure when solidified or stuck in resin.

# Resin
Along with The Mist, a bright white substance is seen, which only appears in solid form. It is often heavily mixed with Mist, causing it to be a shade of grey, though pure Resin is often seen on motile entities. It often glows white when struck due to a very tiny film of it completely turning into energy; despite this, it usually does not get thin enough for the released energy to be dangerous. Due to this property, it is highly sought after. It is also therorized that the Resin is formed from ambient energy in Peregrina Mundi, though no conclusive evidence for this has been found.

Its name is based off of its texture compared to solidified Mist. While Solid Mist is similar to concrete or dirt, Resin is extremely smooth, and feels similar to something made from, well, resin.

# Formation of Matter
The Mist and resin seem to condense and form together in a way that, to some, suggest sentience.
