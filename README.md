# Codex Peregrinus
A handful of cultures include myths and legends that reference a separate dimension in which strange spirits roam, which occasionally intersects with our own either seasonally or via ritual. Though these old tales are far fetched, recent discoveries show that these legends could be derived from true events.

Recently, the discovery and scientific classification of numerous "demons" has resulted in the discovery of Peregrina Mundi, a world befitting of these legends. Unlike these legends, however, it seems to not have any explicit malevolence towards our own, despite how utterly alien it appears.
